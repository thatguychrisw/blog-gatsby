### Observations
Due to the Coronavirus, most (hopefully all!) software companies are now operating with entirely remote staff.  Decision making is now handled mostly in calls, leading to packed calendars and what’s being known as Zoom Fatigue.  Connecting with your peers needs to be planned, and decisions can be difficult to track down, comprehend, and act on.  

These are a new set of challenges for most groups, and I believe we can address the oncoming burnout through effective asynchronous communication and organization.  Below are a few strategies I’ve been experimenting with, I’ll update them as I continue to make new discoveries.

### Making The Most of Calls
