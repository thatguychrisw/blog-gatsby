description: "The coronoavirus' affect on software development remote culture"

### Observations
Due to the Coronavirus, most (hopefully all!) software development companies are now operating with their staff working from home.  Decision making is now handled mostly in calls, leading to packed calendars and whatâ€™s being known as Zoom Fatigue.  Connecting with your peers feels like it needs to be planned out, and decisions can be difficult to track down, comprehend, and act on.  

These are a new set of challenges for most groups, and I believe many of them can be addressed simply by writing and sharing more.  

We can cull our meetings and use our time more efficiently.
